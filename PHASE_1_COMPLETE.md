## What's NOT Working (Yet)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Supabase credentials not configured** - Need to:
1. Create Supabase project
2. Deploy `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Add credentials to `.env.local`

‚ö†Ô∏è **OpenAI API not connected** - Need to:
1. Add `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env.local`
2. Test real multi-agent consultations
3. Verify conversation flow end-to-end

‚ö†Ô∏è **ChatInterface not using aiOrchestrator** - Need to:
1. Update `ChatInterface.tsx` to call `aiOrchestrator.processUserMessage()`
2. Display specialist consultations in UI
3. Show suggested follow-up actions

‚ö†Ô∏è **Voice interface not integrated with new architecture** - Need to:
1. Connect voice services to conversationStore
2. Persist voice conversations to database
3. Enable voice-triggered specialist consultations

## How to Continue

### For You (User)

1. **Review this implementation**
   - Read SETUP.md for overview
   - Review ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md for technical details
   - Check COST_ANALYSIS.md for operating costs

2. **Decide on Phase 2 priorities**
   - Do you want to deploy Supabase first?
   - Or connect ChatInterface to real AI first?
   - Or test voice integration first?

3. **Provide API keys (when ready)**
   - Supabase URL + Anon Key
   - OpenAI API Key (you may already have one)

### For Me (Claude)

**Awaiting your direction on Phase 2:**

- **Option A**: Deploy Supabase and set up real database
- **Option B**: Connect ChatInterface to aiOrchestrator with OpenAI
- **Option C**: Test multi-agent flow with mock data first
- **Option D**: Build enhanced voice interface
- **Option E**: Something else you have in mind
