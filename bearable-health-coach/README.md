## 🎙️ Voice Customization & Setup

### Finding Your Perfect Voice
The app automatically selects the most human-like voice available on your system, but you can customize this:

1. **Current Voice Detection**: Check the browser console for "Using voice:" logs to see what voice is active
2. **Available Voices**: The app prioritizes:
   - iOS/macOS: Enhanced neural voices (Samantha Enhanced, Allison Enhanced, etc.)
   - Google Chrome: Neural voices (Google US English Female)
   - Windows: Microsoft neural voices (Aria, Jenny)

### 🤝 Collaborative Voice Development
*Working together to find the perfect voice for your wellness journey*

**For voice samples and customization:**
1. **Share Audio**: You can share voice samples you'd like me to emulate
2. **Voice Parameters**: We'll adjust rate, pitch, and tone together
3. **Iterative Testing**: Real-time feedback loop to perfect the experience
4. **Personal Preferences**: Tell me what voice qualities resonate with you

**Current Voice Settings:**
- Rate: 0.75 (conversational pace)
- Pitch: 0.88 (warm, nurturing tone)
- Volume: 0.95
- Enhanced text preprocessing for natural flow

### Voice Troubleshooting
```bash
# Check available voices in browser console
console.log(speechSynthesis.getVoices().map(v => ({name: v.name, lang: v.lang})))

# Test voice manually
speechSynthesis.speak(new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Hello, this is a test'))
```
