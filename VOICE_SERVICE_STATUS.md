1. Go to deployed app
2. Navigate to a component that uses `ElevenLabsVoiceSettings`
3. Select a voice specialist
4. Click "Preview Voice" button
5. **Expected**: Should hear voice introduction

### Test 2: Voice Coaching Session
1. Go to dashboard
2. Click "Start Voice Chat"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What NEEDS User Testing

1. **Voice Button Click**: Does "Start Voice Chat" work?
2. **Microphone Access**: Does browser request permissions?
3. **Audio Playback**: Does voice actually play in browser?
4. **Conversation Flow**: Can user speak and get AI voice responses?
5. **Error Handling**: What happens if mic denied or audio fails?

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

### API Key Permissions
The current ElevenLabs key has limited permissions:
- ‚úÖ `text-to-speech` - Works
- ‚ùå `voices_read` - Missing (can't list available voices)

**Impact**:
- Voice generation works fine
- Listing available voices from API fails
- We use hardcoded voice IDs (which is fine)

### Browser Constraints
- Microphone requires HTTPS (Vercel provides this ‚úÖ)
- Audio autoplay may be blocked by browser
- WebRTC requires user gesture to start

---

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### For You (User)
1. **Open deployed app**: https://bearable-voice-coach-39shy2d2x-jeff-levines-projects.vercel.app
2. **Click "Start Voice Chat"** on dashboard
3. **Grant microphone permissions**
4. **Try speaking**: "I'm stressed and can't sleep"
5. **Report back**: Did you hear voice? Did it respond?

### If Voice Doesn't Work
Provide me with:
- Browser console errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
- Network tab errors (F12 ‚Üí Network tab)
- Any error messages shown in UI
- Which button you clicked
